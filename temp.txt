A 56-year-old male presented with an 8-year history of progressive difficulty in walking, characterized by stiffness and weakness in the lower limbs, increased balance issues, and tingling sensations in both hands. Visual problems were noted since the age of 7, and he is legally blind. Examination revealed globally pale optic discs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) indicated significant thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer. The patient exhibited marked asymmetric spastic paraparesis, with the left lower limb more affected than the right. Reflexes were heightened at the knees and reduced at the ankles. Sensation to pinprick was diminished in a glove and stocking pattern, and vibration sense was absent in all four limbs. Neuroimaging indicated signs consistent with inflammatory demyelination. A comprehensive blood panel returned normal results, and anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies were not detected.OPA1 genetic testing revealed a previously reported pathogenic heterozygous splice site mutation, c.870+5G>A.
